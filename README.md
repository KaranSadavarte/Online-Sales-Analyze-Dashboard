# Online-Sales-Analyze-Dashboard
The objective of this project is to design an interactive dashboard that enables the store owner to visualize online order trends, total revenue, top-performing categories, and customer behavior in a clear and actionable format. The dashboard is built from raw data collected via Google Forms and preprocessed in Google Sheets.
